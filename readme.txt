== Description ==

YOU MAY DELETE THIS FILE AND ANY OTHER FILE(S) BEFORE STARTING YOUR PROJECT

TotalBlank is a completely clean starter theme for WordPress. No scripts, no styles, no unnecessary files. Only the essential minimum to start working on your own theme. All you need to replace is the theme information in style.css and the screenshot.

If you're creating your own theme or client project, open up all files and do a "Find and Replace All" on the word "TotalBlank" with your own project name.
